A variable scope in a set of rules that determines what part of your code has access to which variable. 
For block scopes, variables only affect the code within a particular function. For global scopes, variables affect your entire code. 
Global variables are avoided because prone to bugs. Since global scopes affect all variables across your entire code. 
Variables will tend to overlap each other cause many problems within your code.

Strict mode reinforces using let and const when creating variables and if your don't have them while creating a variable an error message will be triggered. 
You write 'strict mode' above your code to do so. A side effect is when a function reaches outside of it scopes and affects other code in the process. 
Pure functions don't have side effects and isn't an indeterminate.
